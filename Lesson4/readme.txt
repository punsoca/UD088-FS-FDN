Notes: 

Templates Usage and Locations
-----------------------------

Lesson4'S Topic5  and Topic6 DO NOT require the templates folder.

The finalproject.py in Lesson4/Topic7  and Lesson4/Topic8 use templates from Lesson4/templates folder.

Templates for Lesson4/Topic9/finalproject.py  are under the Lesson4/Topic9/templates folder.

Please be guided accordingly.

To run the final project:
--------------------------
Lesson4 folder has multiple topics folders (Topic5  thru Topic9).  Each topic has three (3) python programs: database.py, lotsofmenus.py, and finalproject.py.

Run each topic ONE AT A TIME:

1. Navigate to the Full-Stack-Foundations/Lesson-4/TopicX/Final-Project directory inside the vagrant environment.

2. Delete restaurantmenu.db (if it exists).

3. Run database_setup.py to create the 'restaurantmenu' database.

3. run lotsofmenus.py to populate the 'restaurantmenu' database.

4. copy the templates folder to the /home/vagrant folder in the vagrant environment (follow instructions from the "Templates Usage and Locations" section above).

5. run finalproject.py and navigate to localhost:5000 in your browser.
